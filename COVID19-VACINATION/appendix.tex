Consider the following cost functional that we want to minimize
\begin{equation}\label{costFunctional}
  \int_0^T C(t,X(t),u(t)) dt
\end{equation}
subject to the dynamics
\begin{equation}\label{dynamics}
  \dot{X}(t) = f(t,X(t),u(t)),  \qquad    0\leq t \leq T,
\end{equation}
and the initial state $X(0)=x_0$. Let $t_0<t_1<\ldots <t_n$, with
$t_0=0$ and $t_n=T$, be a partition of the interval $[0,T]$.
We consider {\it piecewise constant controls} $\tilde{u}$ of the form
\begin{equation}\label{PieceConstCont}
  \tilde{u}(t) = a_j\qquad t_j\leq t < t_{j+1}
\end{equation}
 for $j=0,\ldots,n-1$.

{\sc Assumption 1}.

{\sc Assumption 2}.

By Assumption 1, the system
\[
  \dot{X}(t) = f(t,X(t),a_0), \quad X(0)=x_0, \qquad    0\leq t \leq t_1,
\]
has a unique solution $\tilde{X}_0(t;x_0,a_0)$ which is continuous in
$(x_0,a_0)$.  Next, put $x_1:=\tilde{X}_0(t_1;x_0,a_0)$ and consider the system
\[
  \dot{X}(t) = f(t,X(t),a_1), \quad X(t_1)=x_1, \qquad    t_1\leq t \leq t_2,
\]
which, again by Assumption 1, has a unique solution $\tilde{X}_1(t;x_1,a_1)$
continuous in $(x_1,a_1)$. By following this procedure, we end up having a
recursive solution
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{aligned}
    & \tilde{X}_{n-1}(t;x_{n-1},a_{n-1}),\\
    & x_{n-1}:=\tilde{X}_{n-2}(t_{n-1};x_{n-2},a_{n-1}),
    \quad t_{n-1}\leq t \leq T.
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
Thus, for a control $\tilde{u}$ of the form \eqref{PieceConstCont} and the
corresponding solution path $\tilde{X}$, we have
\[
  \int_0^T
    C(t,\tilde{X}(t),
    \tilde{u}(t)) dt =
      \sum_{j=0}^{n-1}
        \int_{t_j}^{t_{j+1}}
        C(t,\tilde{X}_j(t),a_j) dt.
\]
Notice that each $\tilde{X}_j$ is a continuous function of $(a_0,\ldots,a_j)$
and $x_0$. Therefore, by Assumption 2, the mapping
\[
  (a_0,\ldots,a_{n-1})
  \mapsto
  \sum_{j=0}^{n-1}
  \int_{t_j}^{t_{j+1}} C(t,\tilde{X}_j(t),a_j) dt
\]
is continuous.

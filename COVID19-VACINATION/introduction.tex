    Comment about the solution of the underlying Optimal Control Problem
    \comment[id=SDIV]{David}
    
One of the main features of our model is that we consider piecewise constant control policies instead of general measurable control policies. General control policies are difficult to implement since the authority has to make different choices every instant. The optimal policies we find are constant in each interval of time and hence these policies are easier to implement. 

Optimal control problems with piecewise constant policies have been widely studied:  solution method \cite{MR3228405}, convergence \cite{MR3627992}.

However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of such policies in epidemics control.

Despite that NPIs has been implemented in most countries to mitigate COVID-19,
these strategies can not develop immunity.
Thus, vaccination becomes the primary pharmaceutical measure. However, this
vaccine has to be effective and well implemented in global vaccination
programs, and each development implies particular issues. Thus new challenges
in distribution, stocks, politics, vaccination efforts, among others, emerge.
In this work, we have studied the effect of the combined strategy
lockdown-vaccination and our result suggest that the NPIs would be essential to
face the new emergent problems with the accepted vaccines.

We see it very important to implement stratification by risk and age. Thus our
efforts will be directed in combination with the result presented in this
manuscript.

\paragraph{$R_0$ definition}
%
The basic reproductive number, which is generally denoted by $ R_0 $,
is a threshold quantity with which we can use 
particular control strategies. The epidemiological interpretation of 
$ R_0 $ is the average number of secondary cases produced by an infected
individual introduced into a population of susceptible individuals.
Using Van DenDrishe's \cite{VandenDriessche2017a} definition of reproductive number
we obtain
\begin{equation*}
    \label{eqn:reproductive_number}
    \begin{aligned}
        R_0 :=
        &
        \frac{\kappa}{(\kappa + \mu)(\delta_L + \mu)}
        \left(
            \mu R_1 + \delta_L
        \right)
        \left[
            \frac{p\beta_S}{R_2}
            +\frac{(1 - p) \beta_A}{\gamma_A+\mu}
        \right],
    \\
    \text{where} &
    \\
        R_1 &= 1 - \theta(1 - \epsilon),
    \\
        R_2 &= \mu + \delta_H + \gamma_S + \mu_{I_{S}}.
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
%
The factor $\frac{p\beta_S}{R_2}$ measures the proportion of new infections
generated by a symptomatic infectious individual in the time that it lasts
infected. In a similar way, the factor $\frac{(1 - p) \beta_A}{\gamma_A+\mu}$
measures the new infections generated by an asymptomatic infectious individual
in the time that it lasts infected. The factor 
$\frac{\mu R_1 + \delta_L}{\delta_L + \mu}$ measures the number
of individuals in lockdown that leave the lockdown, which can be infected.
And finally, the factor $\frac{\kappa}{\kappa + \mu}$ measures
the time of the disease's incubation.
%
If we consider that there is no lockdown, we have that $ R_0 $ is reduced to
\begin{equation*}
    \label{eqn:reproductive_number}
    \begin{aligned}
        \tilde{R}_0 :=
        &
        \frac{\kappa}{(\kappa + \mu)}
        \left[
            \frac{p\beta_S}{R_2}
            +\frac{(1 - p) \beta_A}{\gamma_A+\mu}
        \right].
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
%
<<<<<<< HEAD
Note that we have the relation $ R_0 \leq \tilde{R}_0 $. These indicate that there is greater
 transmission of the disease if there is no lockdown.

Considering assumptions 2, we can establish a vaccine reproductive number,
in which individuals who have already been vaccinated
can become infected individuals by being in contact with the
symptomatic infected. Using Van den Driesscheâ€™s \cite{VandenDriessche2017a}
definition of reproductive number and \cite{Alexander2004}, we obtain

\begin{equation*}
 R_{0}^V := \left[ 1-\frac{\varepsilon \lambda_V}
 {\mu+\lambda_V+\delta_V}
 -\frac{\theta\mu(1-\epsilon)}{\mu+\delta_L+\lambda_V}\right]
 (\mu R_1+\delta_L)R_0.
\end{equation*}
%
The threshold quantity $R_0^V$ is the reproductive number of infection
which can be interpreted as the number of infected people produced
by one infected individual introduced into the population in the
presence of vaccination.

In the gray region of the \cref{fig:Nolockdown}, you can see
the values of vaccine efficacy and vaccination rate for which
$R_0^V <1 $. In this figure, we consider that the lockdown effect is not present.
If we take $ \varepsilon = 0.2 $, we can see that we always have $ R_0^V> 1 $
with which choice of $ \lambda_V $.

In the\cref{fig:Lockdown}, we take into account that the lockdown effect is
present. We can see that the gray region, $R_0^V<1 $, is much larger than in
the figure. Note that we can choose smaller values for $ \varepsilon $ and 
$\lambda_V $ when we do have an individual lockdown.
